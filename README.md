## Files in this repo

Rmd file for teaching forecasting 
* [TemplateForecasting.Rmd](TemplateForecasting.Rmd) is an example of Rmd file that can be processed with RStudio. It is an example of analysis of a time series with Holt-Winters algorithms.  
* The output file is in html format ([TemplateForecasting.html](TemplateForecasting.html)) that is readable with any browser (e.g. Chrome / Internet explorer / Qwant/...).
* some help is provided in the file [HelpTemplateForecastingRmd.pdf](HelpTemplateForecastingRmd.pdf)

Other Rmd files (with their corresponding html file)
* [TSD.Rmd](TSD.Rmd)  time series differencing:  illustrations using arima.sim
* [ARmodels.Rmd](ARmodels.Rmd) AR models and Yule-Walker  equations.
* [DowjonesAR1D1.Rmd](DowjonesAR1D1.Rmd)  selecting an ARIMA(p,d,q) for  a time series and computing forecasts.
* [MAmodels.Rmd](MAmodels.Rmd) MA(1) models using arima.sim
* [LinearRegression.Rmd](LinearRegression.Rmd) Example of Linear Regression
* [LinearRegressionForecasting.Rmd](LinearRegressionForecasting.Rmd) Example of Linear Regression for time series 

R file for teaching forecasting 
* [SimulationSeasonalArima.R](SimulationSeasonalArima.R) allows to create seasonal arima time series and see their resulting ACF and PACF plots.
